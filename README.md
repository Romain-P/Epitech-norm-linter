# Epitech Norm Linter
An Atom package that lints your code with a norm checker

###### By [Arignir](mailto:tigearth@hotmail.fr)

## Use

* This package needs the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) package to work.

* When you save a file, a norm checker will be executed and the result will be displayed using the [linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) package.

* This package works with the norm checker made by duponc_j and <a href="https://github.com/motet-a/yan">Yan</a>, made by motet_a.
